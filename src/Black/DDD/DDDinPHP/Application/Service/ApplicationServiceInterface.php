 * Application Services are the interface used by the outside world, where the outside world canâ€™t communicate via our
 * Entity objects, but may have other representations of them.  Application Services could map outside messages to
 * internal operations and processes, communicating with services in the Domain and Infrastructure layers to provide
 * cohesive operations for outside clients.
